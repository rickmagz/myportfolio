                One hundred milliliters (about 3.3 ounces [oz]) of regular black coffee (without milk or cream) is
                low in calories. That is about one typical cup of black coffee, and it only contains around 2
                calories. However, adding cream or sugar will increase the calorific value.

                Coffee beans also contain polyphenols, which are a type of antioxidant. Antioxidants can help
                protect the body against free radical damage. Free radicals are a type of waste product that the
                body naturally produces as a result of certain processes.

                Free radicals act as toxins in the body and may cause inflammation. Scientists have found links
                between inflammation and various aspects of metabolic syndrome, including type 2 diabetes and
                obesity.

                In 2018, some researchersTrusted Source suggested that the antioxidant content of coffee may offer
                protection from metabolic syndrome.

                Although scientists can prove that certain compounds are present in coffee beans, it remains unclear
                what happens to them once they enter the human body.
